Version 0.3.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed segfault for print.status=0

* Forcing CRAN binary to use later version of Rcpp, to get rid of the 
  MatrixRow bug


Version 0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix for default MCMC simulation size of 0, which threw confusing errors.

* Removed most plotting functions (the ones depending on ggplot2). The ggplot2
  dependency was more trouble that it was worth. biplot still works, however.

* Added a coef method, which returns posterior samples of the implied regression
  coefficients for conditional response distributions

* Bugfix for imputing missing data.
