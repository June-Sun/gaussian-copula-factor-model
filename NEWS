Version 0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add accessor functions to extract (samples of) posterior loadings/scores
* Remove references to the missing plot_loadings function in examples
* Remove center.data and scale.data arguments to bfa_* functions
* Doc fixes; also documenting the mean vector options in bfa_gauss and bfa_mixed
  
Version 0.3.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixes some naming issues from C++11, per CRAN maintainers
* Removes dependence on arma's RNG. Results from previous
  versions will not replicate exactly.

Version 0.3.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* bfa_gauss can include a mean vector by supplying additional (undocumented)
  arguments include_mean=TRUE and mean_mu0, mean_phi0 which are length p
  vectors giving the componentwise prior mean and precision (respectively) for
  the normal prior on E(y).

Version 0.3.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed segfault for print.status=0

* Forcing CRAN binary to use later version of Rcpp, to get rid of the 
  MatrixRow bug


Version 0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix for default MCMC simulation size of 0, which threw confusing errors.

* Removed most plotting functions (the ones depending on ggplot2). The ggplot2
  dependency was more trouble than it was worth. biplot still works, however.

* Added a coef method, which returns posterior samples of the implied regression
  coefficients for conditional response distributions

* Bugfix for imputing missing data.
